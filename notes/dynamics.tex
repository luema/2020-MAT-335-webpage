\section*{About the Document}

This document is a hybrid of many linear algebra resources, including those of
the IOLA (Inquiry Oriented Linear Algebra) project and Jason Siefken's
IBL Linear Algebra project.

This document is a mix of short problems and more involved exploratory question. A typical
class day looks like:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Introduction by instructor.} This may involve giving a definition,
		a broader context for the day's topics, or answering questions.

	\item {\bf Students work on problems.} Students work individually or in pairs/small groups
		on the prescribed problem. During this time the instructor moves
		around the room addressing questions that students may have and giving
		one-on-one coaching.

	\item {\bf Instructor intervention.} When most students have successfully solved
		the problem, the instructor refocuses the class by providing an
		explanation or soliciting explanations from students.
		This is also time for the instructor to ensure that everyone has
		understood the main point of the exercise (since it is sometimes
		easy to miss the point!).

		If students are having trouble, the instructor can give hints
		and additional guidance to ensure students' struggle is productive.

	\item {\bf Repeat step 2.}
\end{enumerate}

Using this format, students are thinking (and happily so) most of the class. Further,
after struggling with a question, students are especially primed to hear the insights of the instructor.

These problems are geared towards concepts instead of computation, though some problems
focus on simple computation. The questions also have a geometric lean. Vectors are initially
introduced with familiar coordinate notation, but eventually, coordinates are understood to be
\emph{representations} of vectors rather than ``true'' geometric vectors, and objects like the
determinant are defined via oriented volumes rather than formulas involving matrix entries.

	\section*{Dynamical Systems}

	\begin{definition}[Dynamical System]
		A pair $(T,X)$ is called a \emph{dynamical system} if
		$X$ is a set and $T:X\to X$ is a function. In the context of
		a dynamical system, $T$ is often called a \emph{transformation}.
	\end{definition}

	This definition is very general, and most things you encounter could be considered
	a dynamical system. For example, if $X=\{\text{air molecules and their positions on earth}\}$
	and $T:X\to X$ is the result of the wind blowing for one second, then $(T,X)$ is a dynamical system.
	Alternatively, we could take the state of your computer's memory (RAM) to be a set and your processor executing a single
	instruction to be a transformation.

	It's hard to say much about general dynamical systems.
	However, throughout the course, we will find ways to classify dynamical systems. Once we ``narrow the field'',
	we'll be able to say lot's of interesting things.

	\subsection*{Newton's Method}
	Newton's method is a way of using tangent-line approximations to functions to estimate their roots.
	It is an iterative procedure\footnote{ Whenever something is iterative, you should think dynamics!}.

	\question
	Let $f:\R\to\R$ be a differentiable function and let $T_f:\{\text{guesses}\}\to\{\text{guesses}\}$ be
	a single application of Newton's method.

	\begin{parts}
		\item Find a general formula for $T_f$.
		\item Let $f(x)=x(x-2)(x-3)$. Compute $T_f^n(4)$ for $n=0,1,2,3$.
		\item Do you think
			\[
				\lim_{n\to\infty} T_f^n(4)
			\]
			converges? If so, what does it converge to? Can you prove your answer?
	\end{parts}

	\begin{definition}[Fixed Point]
		Let $(T,X)$ be a dynamical system. A point $a\in X$ is called a \emph{fixed point} if
		$T(a)=a$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Basin of Attraction]
		Let $(T,X)$ be a dynamical system and let $x\in X$. The \emph{basin of attraction}
		of $x$ is the set
		\[
			A_x=\Set{y\in X: \lim_{n\to\infty} T^ny=x}.
		\]
	\end{definition}
	Eventually, we will talk about more general \emph{basins of attraction}, but for now we will limit ourselves to
	that of a single point.

	\question
	Let $f(x)=x(x-2)(x-3)$ and let $T_f$ be the function that applies a single iteration of Newton's method (as before).
	\begin{parts}
		\item Is $[3,4)\subseteq A_3$ for $T_f$? What about $[100, 1000]$? $(2,3)$?
		\item Describe $A_3$.
		\item Is $A_3$ connected?
	\end{parts}

	\newpage
	\begin{definition}[Inverse Image]
		Let $f:A\to B$ be a function and let $X\subseteq B$. The \emph{inverse image} of $X$
		under $f$, denoted $f^{-1}(X)$, is
		\[
			f^{-1}(X)=\Set{x\in A\given f(x)\in X}.
		\]
	\end{definition}
	Note: a function \emph{need not} be invertible to have inverse images. In fact, the idea of inverse images applies
	to \emph{every} function.

	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item Let $g:\R\to\R$ be defined by $g(x)=x^2$. Find $g^{-1}(\Set{1})$,
			$g^{-1}(\Set{4})$, $g^{-1}(\Set{0})$, $g^{-1}(\Set{-1})$, and $g^{-1}([3,4])$.
		\item Let $f$ and $T_f$ be as before. (Recall, $f(x)=x(x-2)(x-3)$). Find $T_f^{-1}([3,4))$.
		\item Define
			\[
				Q=\bigcup_{n\geq 0} T_f^{-n}([3,3.1))
			\]
			where $T_f^0$ is the identity function.

			Is $Q=A_3$? Why or why not?
	\end{parts}

	\newpage
	Using a computer, we can graph $A_0$, $A_2$, and $A_3$.

	We've just seen our first {\bf fractal}! For now, we will define a \emph{fractal}
	as a set with repeated patterns at all scales.

	\newpage
	\section*{Fractals}
	Let's construct some famous fractals.

	\question
	Let $K_0$ be an equilateral triangle with sides of length $1$. 
	Let $K_1$ be the result
	of applying 
	\mbox{
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture} $\to$ 
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1/3,0) -- (1/2, .23) -- (2/3, 0) -- (1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}} to each side of $K_0$. Repeat this process to get $K_2$ from $K_1$, etc. and define
	\[
		K_{\infty} = \lim_{n\to\infty} K_n.
	\]
	\begin{parts}
		\item Draw $K_0$, $K_1$, and $K_2$.
		\item Find the perimeter of $K_0$, $K_1$, and $K_2$. Find a general
			formula for the perimeter of $K_n$.
		\item What is the perimeter of $K_{\infty}$? What is the area enclosed by
			$K_{\infty}$?
	\end{parts}
	$K_\infty$ is called the \emph{Koch Snowflake}.

	\question
	Let $T_0$ be a filled-in equilateral triangle. To get $T_1$, $T_2$, etc., apply the substitution
	rule
	\mbox{
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\fill[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1,0) -- (.5, .866);
	\end{tikzpicture} $\to$ 
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6, even odd rule]
		\fill[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1,0) -- (.5, .866)  (.5,0) -- (1/4,.433) -- (3/4, .433);
	\end{tikzpicture}} to each (sub)triangle of $T_0$, $T_1$, etc..  Define $T_{\infty}$ to be the limit
	of this process.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Draw $T_0$, $T_1$, and $T_2$.
		\item Find a formula for the area of $T_n$.
		\item Compute the area of $T_\infty$.
		\item Is $T_\infty$ the empty set? Why or why not?
	\end{parts}
	$T_\infty$ is called \emph{Sierpinski's Triangle}.

	\question
	Let $C_0=[0,1]$ be the unit interval. Recursively define $C_i$ by the substitution
	rule 
	\mbox{
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture} $\to$ 
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1/3,0)  (2/3, 0) -- (1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}}, which removes the middle $1/3$ of every interval. 
	Define $C_\infty$ to be the limit of this process.


	\begin{parts}
		\item Compute the length of $C_n$.
		\item Compute the length of $C_\infty$.
	\end{parts}
	$C_\infty$ is called the \emph{Cantor set}.


	\bigskip
	Our normal sense of measurement fails when it comes to these fractals. We need a new idea: \emph{similarity dimension}.

	\newpage
	\subsection*{Dimension}

	Dimension can be thought of as a relationship between scale and content\footnote{Here ``content'' refers to the ``stuff inside'' of an object.}.

	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item 
		Let $\ell=[0,1)$, $2\ell=[0,2)$, $3\ell=[0,3)$, etc.. How many disjoint copies of $\ell$ does it take to
		cover $n\ell$?
		\item Let $S=[0,1)^2$, $2S=[0,2)^2$, etc.. How many disjoint copies of $S$ does it take to cover $nS$?
		\item Let $C=[0,1)^3$, $2C=[0,2)^3$, etc.. How many disjoint copies of $C$ does it take to cover $nC$?
		\item Based on the patterns you see, describe an algorithm that can be used to find the dimensions of $\ell$, $S$, and
			$C$.
		\item Let $T$ be the filled-in equilateral triangle. Apply your algorithm to $2T$.
		\item Let $T_\infty$ be the Sierpinski triangle. Apply your algorithm to $2T_\infty$. Does the number you get
			make sense?
	\end{parts}

	\begin{definition}[Similarity Dimension]
		A set $Q\subseteq \R^n$ has \emph{similarity dimension} $d$ if there exists a $c\in \Z$
		and $s\in \R^+$ satisfying
		\[
			d=\log_s(c)
		\]
		and $sQ$ ($Q$ scaled up by a factor of $s$) is covered by
		$c$ copies of $Q$ (at most overlapping on their boundaries).

	\end{definition}

	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item Compute the similarity dimension of a (a) a line segment, (b) the Cantor set, and (c) Sierpinski's triangle.
		\item Compute the similarity dimension of the Koch snowflake.
	\end{parts}

	What about sets that aren't self-similar? 

	\question
	Let $K_\infty'$ be the ``Koch snowflake'' obtained with the substitution rule
	\mbox{
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture} $\to$ 
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
		\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1/3,0) -- (1/2, -.23) -- (2/3, 0) -- (1,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}}.

	\begin{parts}
		\item Find the perimeter and dimension of $K_{\infty}'$.
		\item Let $K_{\text{strange}}$ be the ``Koch snowflake'' obtained by 
		the rule \mbox{
			\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
				\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1,0);
			\end{tikzpicture} $\to$ 
			\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
				\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1/3,0) -- (1/2, .23) -- (2/3, 0) -- (1,0);
			\end{tikzpicture} or 
			\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
				\draw[blue, thick] (0,0)--(1/3,0) -- (1/2, -.23) -- (2/3, 0) -- (1,0);
			\end{tikzpicture}
			} chosen randomly at each stage.
		What should the dimension of $K_{\text{strange}}$ be? Can you compute it's similarity dimension?
	\end{parts}

	\newpage
	We need a way to define dimension for shapes that aren't self-similar. Let's again work from
	sets whose dimension we know: cubes.

	\begin{definition}[Box Covering]
		A $d$-dimensional \emph{box covering} of $X\subseteq \R^k$ is a collection $C=\Set{B_i}$ of 
		$d$-dimensional cubes which satisfy
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item if $i\neq j$, $B_i$ and $B_j$ intersect at most on their boundaries;
			\item $B_i\cap X\neq \Set{}$ for all $i$;
			\item $X\subseteq \bigcup_{i} B_i$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Outer Measure]
		The \emph{$d$-dimensional outer measure} of $X\subseteq \R^k$ is
		\[
			\lim_{n\to\infty} \text{volume}(C_n)
		\]
		where $C_n$ is a $d$-dimensional box covering of $X$ with cubes of side-length $1/n$.
	\end{definition}

	\question
	Let $\ell\subseteq \R^3$ be the line segment from $\vec 0$ to $(1,0,0)$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Find the $1$, $2$, and $3$-dimensional outer measures of $\ell$.
		\item Does $\ell$ have a $0$-dimensional outer measure?
		\item Let $T\subseteq \R^3$ be the filled in triangle with vertices $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$,
			and $(0,1,0)$. Find the $1$, $2$, and $3$-dimensional outer measures of $T$.
		\item Find the $1$-dimensional outer measure of the Cantor set.
	\end{parts}

	\newpage
	What would it mean to have a fractional-dimensional outer measure? Let $B$ be a $d$-dimensional
	box with side lengths $k$. Its volume is $k^d$. Divide the box in half along every dimension and 
	each sub-box has volume $(k/2)^d=(1/2)^dk^d$, and so there must be $2^d$ sub-boxes.

	What if there were fewer ``sub-boxes''?

	\question
	Let $C_\alpha$ be the Cantor-like set obtained by removing the middle $\alpha$ of each subinterval.
	(I.e., the standard Cantor set is $C_{1/3}$.)
	\begin{parts}
		\item Find the number of boxes in a $1$-dimensional box-covering of $C_{0}$ 
			(the interval) and  $C_{1/3}$ where the width of each box is $1/3$, $1/9$, $1/27$, etc..
		\item Based on what you know about how many width-$k$ boxes it takes to fill $d$-dimensional space,
			find a formula relating $d$, the number of boxes, and the width of the boxes.
		\item Use your formula to estimate $d$ for $C_{1/3}$. How does this compare to the similarity-dimension
			of $C_{1/3}$?
	\end{parts}

	\begin{definition}[Box-counting Dimension]
		Let $X\subseteq \R^m$ and let $B\subseteq \R^m$ and let $B$ be a minimal-dimensional, minimally-sized box such
		that $X\subseteq B$. The \emph{box-counting dimension} of $X$ is
		\[
			d=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log(\text{\# of sub-boxes of $B_n$ that intersect $X$})}{\log n},
		\]
		where $B_n$ is $B$ ``cut'' along each axis into $n$ equally-spaced slices.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{parts}[resume]
		\item Find the box-counting dimension of $C_{1/3}$.
		\item Find the box-counting dimension of the unit simplex in $\R^2$. I.e. $\Set{\vec v\in \R^2\given \vec v=
			\alpha\xhat+\beta \yhat\text{ for some }\alpha,\beta\geq 0\text{ satisfying }\alpha+\beta \leq 1
			}$
		\item Intuitively, what should $\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \dim(C_\alpha)$ be? Find the box-counting and similarity
			dimension of $C_\alpha$ and verify.
	\end{parts}
	
	Box-counting dimension is difficult to compute exactly, but it's useful for approximations. Computers are
	pretty good at counting boxes!

	\newpage
	\subsection*{Markov Chains}
	
	\begin{definition}[Transition Matrix]
		Let $\mathcal G$ be a directed graph with vertices $\Set{1,\ldots, n}$.
		A \emph{transition matrix} for $\mathcal G$ is an $n\times n$ matrix $A=[a_{ij}]$ where
		\[
			a_{ij} = \begin{cases}
				1 &\text{ if there is an edge from $i$ to $j$}\\
				0 &\text{ otherwise}
			\end{cases}.
		\]
	\end{definition}

	\question
	The map shows the direct, one-way flights offered by the Pacific
	Rim air shipping company.
	\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{images/flight_map.pdf}
	We can think of their flight map as a graph.


	\begin{parts}
		\item Write down a \emph{transition matrix} $A$ for the above graph.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item What do the diagonal entries tell you about the available flights?
			\item Should $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$? Explain.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Write down a matrix $B=[b_{ij}]$ where the entry $b_{ij}$ indicates the 
		number of ways to take exactly two flights from city $i$ to city $j$.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Compute $A^2$ and compare with $B$.
			\item What information does the $1$st row of $A$ give you about flights?
			\item What information does the $2$nd column of $A$ give you about 
			flights?
			\item Based upon your last two answers what does the $1,2$ entry of

	\begin{definition}[Markov Chain]
		Given a graph $G$, a \emph{stationary Markov chain on $G$}, is a random process,
		denoted $X_1,X_2,\ldots$ where $X_i$.
		
	\end{definition}



	To really understand this situation, we need to know some things about \emph{probability theory}.
	A central object of study in probability theory are \emph{random variables}.

	\begin{definition}[Random Variable]
		Let $Q$ be a set. A \emph{random variable with state space $Q$} is a function $X:[0,1]\to Q$.
	\end{definition}

	We think of a random variable $X:[0,1]\to Q$ as a ``to be determined quantity''. Of course, if $\omega\in [0,1]$, then
	$X(\omega)\in Q$ is an actual element of the state space. It would be incorrect to write ``$X\in Q$''.

	\begin{definition}[Probability Function]
		The \emph{probability function} on $[0,1]$, is a function
		\[
			\P:\Set{\text{measureable subsets of $[0,1]$}}\to[0,1]
		\]
		that assigns every measurable subset of $[0,1]$ a number corresponding to
		the ``percentage'' of $[0,1]$ it occupies.
	\end{definition}

	We often call elements of the domain of $\P$ \emph{events} instead of calling them sets.

	\question
		Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables with state space $\Set{H,T}$ defined by 
		\[
			X(\omega)=\begin{cases}
				H&\text{ if $\omega > 1/2$ }\\
				T&\text{ otherwise}
			\end{cases}\qquad
			Y(\omega)=\begin{cases}
				H&\text{ if $\omega > 2/3$ }\\
				T&\text{ otherwise}
			\end{cases}\qquad
		\]
	\begin{parts}
		\item By writing $X = H$, we mean the event (set) $X^{-1}(H)=\Set{\omega\in[0,1]\given X(\omega)=H}$.

			What is $\P(X=H)$ and $\P(X=T)$? If you were given a fair coin, what would the probability
			of getting heads or tails be?
